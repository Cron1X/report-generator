Encounter 57 – Student Feedback Report

In this lesson, we focused on exercise, injuries, medicine, present perfect continuous, and hypothetical past situations. The unit also developed problem-solving and advice language.

What You Practised

You worked on movement and exercise vocabulary.
Examples you practised:

leap
roll
bend over
stretch
flex
skip

You practised talking about injuries and medicine.
Examples:

I hurt my back.
I have an infection.
What medicine should I take?
How many should I take?
Are there any side effects?

You worked on the present perfect continuous.
Examples:

He has been running for one hour.
He has been running since 3:00 p.m.

You practised explaining reasons using results.
Examples:

He’s tired because he has been running.

You worked on third conditional sentences.
Examples:

If he hadn’t gone jogging, he wouldn’t have fallen.
If he hadn’t fallen, he wouldn’t have hurt his leg.

You practised giving advice and explaining alternatives.
Examples:

You should stretch before exercising.
If you had stretched, you wouldn’t have gotten hurt.

What to Practise More

1. Present Perfect Continuous

Practise for vs since clearly.

2. Third Conditional Chains

Practise linking events logically.

Final Comment

This unit focused on health, time, and hypothetical pasts. To improve further, practise longer explanations using present perfect continuous and third conditional structures.
