In this unit, we built on basic introductions and focused on asking for and giving personal information. You worked on numbers, phone numbers, names, spelling, countries and nationalities, and asking simple questions in a short conversation. You made a good effort to participate and use the target language throughout the lesson.

You practiced asking and answering about names in a clear way.
Examples:
- What’s your name?
- My name is Tim.
- What’s his name?
- His name is Shen.
- What’s her name?

You also worked on spelling names accurately.
Examples:
- Can you spell it, please?
- D-I-E-G-O
- T-I-M
- S-H-E-N

Numbers and phone numbers were an important focus in this unit. You practiced recognising and saying numbers clearly and using them in context.
Examples:
- What’s your phone number?
- My phone number is 555-7793.
- It’s 479-8130.
- It’s 702-3465.

You practiced asking and answering questions about where people are from, using both the country and nationality forms.
Examples:

- They’re from the United States. They’re American.

You were able to follow simple conversation patterns that included several questions.
Examples:

During the communication activities, you practiced taking turns, asking questions, and responding appropriately. You were generally able to stay on task, although at times you needed a little prompting to form full questions.

To continue improving, focus on:
- Asking complete questions without hesitation
- Saying numbers and phone numbers smoothly

Overall, this unit helped you become more confident sharing basic personal information in English. With continued practice, your accuracy and fluency in simple conversations will continue to improve.
