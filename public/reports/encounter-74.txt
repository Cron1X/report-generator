Encounter 74 – Student Feedback Report

In this lesson, we focused on global issues, comparisons, cause-and-effect language, and ranking solutions. The unit developed analytical language for discussing social and environmental problems.

What You Practised

You worked on global issue vocabulary.
Examples practised:

climate change
global warming
deforestation
overpopulation
homelessness
inequality
air pollution

You practised describing and defining problems.
Examples:

Deforestation is the loss of forests.
Climate change is an increase in global temperatures.

You worked on comparisons using more…than and as…as.
Examples:

I’m more concerned about deforestation than global warming.
Slowing global warming is more difficult than preventing deforestation.

You practised cause-and-effect explanations.
Examples:

Climate change leads to more extreme weather.
Stronger hurricanes increase flooding.

You practised ranking problems and solutions.
Examples:

Preventing homelessness is easier than preventing overpopulation.
Reducing emissions is more difficult than changing personal habits.

You practised discussing solutions.
Examples:

Governments could provide free housing.
We should invest in renewable energy.

What to Practise More

Comparative Clarity
Use clear comparison structures when ranking ideas.

Solution Language
Support solutions with reasons.

Final Comment
