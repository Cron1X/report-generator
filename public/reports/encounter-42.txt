Encounter 42 – Student Feedback Report

In this lesson, we focused on food, cooking, making predictions about the future, and explaining cause and result. The unit also developed conditional sentences and sequencing ideas clearly when talking about problems and outcomes, especially in a restaurant context.

What You Practised

You worked on food and cooking vocabulary used to describe ingredients and preparation.
Examples you practised:

egg
tomato
meat
fish
vegetables

cook it in hot oil
cut it into thin pieces
peel the vegetables
fry the chicken
grill the meat

You practised talking about cooking actions in simple steps.
Examples:

First, cut the vegetables.
Then, fry them in hot oil.
After that, add the meat.

You worked on making predictions using will and going to.
Examples:

I think it will be a disaster.
Not many people will go there because it’s too far away.
Lots of people are going to come because it’s something different.
It’s going to be difficult to make money.

You practised first conditional sentences to talk about results.
Examples:

If you grill meat for too long, it will burn.
If the chef is bad, the food will be bad.
If the food is bad, the restaurant will close.

You also worked on explaining reasons and results clearly.
Examples:

We don’t have any customers because our prices are too high.
Our prices are too high. Therefore, we don’t have any customers.
As a result, the restaurant closed.

You practised talking about advantages and disadvantages.
Examples:

Opening a restaurant in the city center is expensive.
Staying open seven days a week can be tiring.
Serving local food can attract customers.

What to Practise More

1. First Conditional Accuracy

If the service is slow, customers will stop coming.
If customers stop coming, the restaurant will close.

2. Explaining Cause and Result Clearly

Use because, therefore, and as a result in full sentences.

Final Comment

This unit focused on food, predictions, and explaining consequences. To improve further, practise linking ideas clearly and using conditional sentences confidently when explaining problems and results.
