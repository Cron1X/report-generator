Encounter 73 – Student Feedback Report

In this lesson, we focused on language learning strategies, motivation, fluency, conditional sentences, and expressing opinions clearly using linking words. The unit developed reflective language for discussing how languages are learned and improved.

What You Practised

You worked on language-learning vocabulary.
Examples practised:

acquire a language
master a skill
fluency
rote learning

You practised talking about fluency and learning processes.
Examples:

Being able to speak without stopping to think.
I want to improve my fluency.
Rote learning can help you remember vocabulary.

You worked on conditional sentences to talk about real and unreal situations.
Examples:

If I move to an English-speaking country, my pronunciation will improve quickly.
If a person lives in a country where English is spoken, it’s easier to learn the language.
If I had been born in England, I would have gone to Oxford.

You practised linking ideas using contrast and addition.
Examples:

I understand Italian. However, I don’t speak it very well.
I speak English and I also speak French.

You practised expressing opinions clearly with reasons.
Examples:

I agree with it because just having talent is not enough.
English would be easier to learn if it didn’t have so many prepositions.

You practised giving advice about learning strategies.
Examples:

If you watch TV in English and write down new vocabulary, you’ll improve your understanding.

What to Practise More

Conditional Accuracy
Practise switching between real and unreal conditionals.

Opinion Expansion
Add reasons and examples when expressing opinions.
