Encounter 12 – Student Feedback Report

In this unit, the focus was on revising familiar language and extending it to talk about clothes and actions happening now. The main language areas were clothing vocabulary, simple adjectives, and the present continuous for describing what people are doing at the moment.

You worked with common clothing words and simple descriptions.
Examples:
- It’s a shirt.
- It’s a jacket.
- It’s a dress.
- It’s a T-shirt.
- It’s a pair of trousers.
- It’s a blue shirt.
- It’s a black jacket.

You also practiced describing what people are wearing using full sentences.
Examples:
- He’s wearing a blue shirt.
- She’s wearing a jacket and jeans.
- He’s wearing a T-shirt and trousers.
- She’s wearing a dress.

A key grammar focus was using the present continuous to talk about actions happening now.
Examples:
- He’s standing.
- She’s sitting.
- They’re listening.
- He’s talking.
- She’s waiting.
- They’re working.

This language was combined so that you could describe both clothes and actions together.
Examples:
- He’s wearing a jacket and standing near the door.
- She’s wearing a blue dress and sitting down.
- They’re wearing uniforms and listening to the teacher.

You also worked with simple questions related to this language.
Examples:
- What is he wearing?
- What is she doing?
- Is he wearing a jacket?
- Are they sitting or standing?

To improve further, focus on:
- Using full sentences every time, especially when answering questions
- Adding colour or extra detail when describing clothes
- Using is / are confidently with the -ing form
- Responding a little faster during speaking tasks

This unit helped build confidence in describing people clearly using simple, useful English. With continued practice, these structures will become more natural and easier to use in conversation.
