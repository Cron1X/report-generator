Encounter 1 – Student Feedback Report

In this unit, we worked on basic introductions, asking and answering names, using my / your / his / her name is, spelling names using the alphabet, and using simple polite expressions. This was an introductory lesson, and you made a good effort to participate and use the target language throughout.

You practiced asking and answering about names in a clear and structured way.

Examples we worked on:
- What’s your name?
- My name is Timmy. / My name’s Timmy.
- What’s his name? – His name is Shen.
- What’s her name? – Her name is Sofi.

You showed understanding of the difference between your, his, and her, and you were generally able to choose the correct form when talking about yourself and other people.

You also practiced spelling names clearly using the alphabet.

Examples:
- Can you spell your name?
- S-H-E-N
- E-M-I-L-Y
- J-I-N
- K-O

You were able to follow the alphabet practice and spell short names accurately, especially during the controlled practice activities.

Polite classroom language was also introduced and practiced.

Examples:
- Please
- Excuse me
- I’m sorry
- Thank you
- You’re welcome

You used these expressions appropriately during the communication activities.

During the pair communication tasks, you practiced short conversations such as:
- Hello, what’s your name?
- My name is Jin.
- Can you spell your name?
- J-I-N. What’s your name?

You were able to follow the conversation pattern and take turns asking and answering questions.

Going forward, you should continue to:
- Use full sentences when introducing yourself
- Practice spelling your name smoothly and confidently
- Be careful to say your name, not you name
- Keep using polite expressions naturally in conversation

Overall, this was a solid start. You can introduce yourself, ask for names, spell simple words, and use polite language in basic conversations. With continued practice, this language will become more natural and automatic for you.
