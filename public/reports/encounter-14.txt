Encounter 14 – Student Feedback Report

In this lesson, we focused on talking about daily routines, transport, and the difference between the present simple and the present continuous. The aim was to describe what usually happens every day and what is happening now, using clear time expressions and simple sentence patterns.

What You Practised

You worked on daily routine vocabulary using the present simple to talk about things that happen regularly.
Examples you practised:

I wake up at seven.
I go to work in the morning.
I have lunch at one o’clock.
I finish work at five.
I go to bed at eleven.

You practised talking about transport and how you travel.
Examples:

I go to work by bus.
I go to school by car.
I walk to work.
I take the train in the morning.

You also practised using time expressions with the present simple.
Examples:

every day
in the morning
in the afternoon
at night
on weekdays

You worked on the present continuous to describe actions happening now.
Examples:

I’m waiting for the bus.
She’s travelling to work.
He’s sitting on the train.
They’re having lunch.

You practised contrasting the present simple and present continuous.
Examples:

I go to work by bus. (every day)
I’m going to work by bus now.

She works in an office.
She’s working at the moment.

You also practised simple questions related to routines and current actions.
Examples:

How do you get to work?
What time do you start work?
What are you doing now?
Are you working today?

What to Practise More

1. Choosing the Correct Tense

Be clear about when to use the present simple and when to use the present continuous.

Practise these examples:

I work on weekdays.
I’m working today.

I take the bus every morning.
I’m taking the bus now.

2. Using Time Expressions Clearly

Always include a time word to make your meaning clear.

Examples to practise:

I start work at eight.
I have lunch at one o’clock.
I’m waiting for the bus now.

3. Asking and Answering Questions in Full Sentences

Practise answering with complete sentences.

Examples:

How do you get to work? – I go to work by bus.
What are you doing now? – I’m waiting for the train.
