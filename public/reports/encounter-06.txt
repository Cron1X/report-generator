Encounter 6 – Student Feedback Report

In this unit, we focused on sharing personal information, spelling, using do and have, and communicating politely in everyday situations such as ordering food and drinks. You participated consistently and made a clear effort to use the language in context.

You practiced asking and answering personal questions clearly.
Examples:
- What’s your name?
- How old are you?
- Are you married?
- Are you single?
- Do you have children?

You also worked on spelling names and key words accurately.
Examples:
- Can you spell it, please?
- A-L-I
- M-O-H-A-M-M-E-D

Using do and have was an important focus when talking about possession.
Examples:
- Do you have water?
- Yes, I do. / No, I don’t.
- Have you got a phone?
- Yes, I have. / No, I haven’t.

Polite language was practiced through simple role-play activities, especially in restaurant situations.
Examples:
- Can I have water, please?
- I’d like a sandwich.
- Can I order the soup, please?
- Thank you.

You were generally able to follow the conversation patterns and respond appropriately. At times, you needed a little prompting to form complete answers, but your willingness to participate was positive.

To continue improving, focus on:
- Using full sentences instead of short answers
- Choosing do or have more confidently
- Speaking a little more smoothly without stopping to think

Overall, this unit helped you communicate more confidently in everyday situations. With continued practice, your fluency and accuracy will continue to improve.
