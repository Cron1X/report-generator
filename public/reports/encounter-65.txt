Encounter 65 – Student Feedback Report

In this lesson, we focused on food descriptions, cooking processes, making deductions, and handling restaurant complaints. The unit also developed sequencing language and cause-and-effect explanations.

What You Practised

You worked on describing food and ingredients.
Examples you practised:

It’s delicious and mouth-watering.
It’s disgusting and tasteless.
ripe fruit
fresh ingredients
moldy strawberries

You practised choosing food based on quality.
Examples:

I choose fruit that’s ripe and fresh.
I wouldn’t choose strawberries that are moldy or too soft.

You worked on cooking processes and sequencing.
Examples:

First, wash the vegetables.
Then chop them.
Mix them with oil and vinegar.

You practised cooking verbs.
Examples:

rinse
chop
measure
stir
pour
bake
slice

You practised making deductions using modal verbs.
Examples:

You might have had the oven too high.
You could have cooked it too long.
You must have forgotten to turn the oven down.

You practised explaining reasons using because.
Examples:

I couldn’t use the chicken because it had passed its sell-by date.

You practised restaurant complaint language.
Examples:

The soup tasted disgusting.
The kitchen was really dirty.
We complained to the chef.

What to Practise More

1. Deduction Language

Practise might have, could have, and must have with clear reasons.

2. Clear Sequencing

Use first, then, after that, finally consistently.

Final Comment

This unit focused on food, processes, and problem-solving. To improve further, practise explaining causes clearly and using deduction language confidently.
