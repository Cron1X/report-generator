Encounter 54 – Student Feedback Report

In this lesson, we focused on education systems, past sequences of events, relative clauses, and describing experiences at university. The unit also developed linking ideas using time expressions.

What You Practised

You worked on education-related vocabulary.
Examples you practised:

undergraduate school
graduate school
vocational school
medical school
campus
lecture
dorm

You practised explaining types of education.
Examples:

Graduate school is for another degree.
Vocational school teaches job skills.
Medical school is for doctors.

You worked on explaining results using future consequences.
Examples:

If you don’t pass your exams, you won’t graduate.

You practised sequencing past events using time linkers.
Examples:

By the time I arrived, the lecture had already started.

You practised relative clauses to add information.

You practised describing a typical day at university.

What to Practise More

1. Time Linkers

Use before, after, when, and by the time accurately.

2. Relative Clauses

Avoid repeating information by using that.

Final Comment

This unit focused on education, time order, and description. To improve further, practise linking events clearly and using relative clauses naturally.
