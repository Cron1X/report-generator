In this unit, we focused on telling the time, describing objects using number and colour, working with singular and plural nouns, talking about prices, and discussing simple schedules. You participated well and made a clear effort to use the target language during the activities.

You practiced telling the time using several common forms.
Examples:

You showed growing confidence recognising and saying times when asked, especially during the controlled practice.

You also practiced describing objects clearly using number and colour.

Singular and plural forms were an important focus.

You practiced talking about prices in simple situations.

To continue improving, focus on:
